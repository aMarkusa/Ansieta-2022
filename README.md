# Ansieta - Anxiety monitor

This project was developed as a part of the "Design Thinking and Electronic Prototyping" course during the fall of 2022. Ansieta was created by a team of three:  
Akseli Paakkola, Riccardo Billiato, and Markus Andersson.

## General description
The project aimed to develop a prototype for a habit-related wearable product. Our team decided to start taking a closer look at eating habits, more specifically eating disorders. 
After doing a root-cause analysis, we discovered eating disorders usually are related to some kind of anxiety or anxious behavior. Therefore we decided to come up with something
that would help people manage mild anxiety. In order to gain more knowledge about the problem and its relevance, we conducted interviews and polls with both professionals and potential 
users. Based on the feedback, we developed a conceptual solution.

## Ansieta
Ansieta (derived from the Italian word Ansiet√°, meaning anxiety) is a concept for a wearable product capable of detecting anxiety attacks. Beyond detecting anxiety attacks, Ansieta
also provides the user with tips for managing and preventing attacks.
